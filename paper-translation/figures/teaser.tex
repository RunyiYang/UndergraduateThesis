  \caption{Given two low-overlap point clouds, GeoTransformer improves inlier ratio over vanilla transformer significantly, both for superpoint (patch) level (left) and for dense point level (right). A few representative patch correspondences are visualized with distinct colors. Notice how GeoTransformer preserves the spatial consistency of the matching patches across two point clouds. It corrects the wrongly matched patches around the symmetric corners of the chair back (see the yellow point cloud).}
